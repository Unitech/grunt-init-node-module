# grunt-init-node-module

> Create a Node.js module with [grunt-init][], including Mocha/Should unit tests + mocha cheatsheet in the test file.

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:Alexandre-Strzelewicz/grunt-init-node-module.git ~/.grunt-init/node-module
```

Windows user [documentation deleted], **GO TO HELL**

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init node-module
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
